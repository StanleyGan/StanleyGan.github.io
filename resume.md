Work Experiences
----------
**Research Experience/Machine Learning Experience**  
**Research Intern** in _1QBit, Canada_ &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Sept 2017 – Present
* Working in the machine learning team, focusing on the aspect of integrating knowledge of advanced quantum
computation and machine learning in the area of quantitative finance
* Worked with Accenture Labs and Biogen in developing a first-of-its-kind quantum-enabled molecular
comparison application which could vastly enhance advanced molecular design for drug discovery
* Learned about Agile framework when working with researchers and software developers, and the importance of
communication in meeting client-oriented project deadlines

**Teaching Experience**  
**Teaching Assistant** for _Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms_ in _SFU, Canada_  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Jan 2017 – August 2017  
* Conducted tutorials on topics involving logics, set theory, combinatorics, design and analysis of algorithms using
resources such as textbook, online problem sets to help students build a solid foundation in mathematics
* Marked assignments, midterm exams within a time frame and provided useful feedbacks to the students by
showing common conceptual mistakes during tutorials
* Learned to convey sophisticated concepts in simpler terms, which helps improving communication and
presentation skills
