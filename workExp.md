**Research Experience/Machine Learning Experience**  
**Research Intern** in _1QBit, Canada_  
_Sept 2017 – Present_  
* Working in the machine learning team, focusing on the aspect of integrating knowledge of advanced quantum
computation and machine learning in the area of quantitative finance
* Worked with Accenture Labs and Biogen in developing a first-of-its-kind quantum-enabled molecular
comparison application which could vastly enhance advanced molecular design for drug discovery
* Learned about Agile framework when working with researchers and software developers, and the importance of
communication in meeting client-oriented project deadlines

**Teaching Experience**  
**Teaching Assistant** for _Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms_ in _SFU, Canada_  
_Jan 2017 – August 2017_   
* Conducted tutorials on topics involving logics, set theory, combinatorics, design and analysis of algorithms using
resources such as textbook, online problem sets to help students build a solid foundation in mathematics
* Marked assignments, midterm exams within a time frame and provided useful feedbacks to the students by
showing common conceptual mistakes during tutorials
* Learned to convey sophisticated concepts in simpler terms, which helps improving communication and
presentation skills  

**Research Experience/Optimization Experience**  
**Research Assistant** in _Computational Biology_ in _SFU, Canada_  
_Sept 2016 – Present_  
* Study the diversity of pathogenic bacteria which causes Lyme disease, Borrelia Burgdorferi in tick samples using
mathematical and computational approaches under the supervision of Prof. Chindelevitch and Prof. Chauve
* Mapped and aligned ~60GB Illumina short reads data using Bowtie, SRA Toolkit and ClusterW
* Formulated mixed integer linear programs(MILP) to address different biological problems and coded MILPs
using CPLEX Python API
* Communicated with biologists about their prior expectations on co-infection pattern and the result of this project
will lead to improved ecological prevention and control protocol of Lyme disease

**Operational Research / Optimization Experience**  
**Strategic Planning and Advisory Intern** in _AECOM Asia Co. Ltd., Hong Kong_  
_June 2015 – Aug 2015_
* Participated in constructing a customized transport model for a major bus company in Hong Kong using different
software such as EMME, ArcGIS and Excel, where the company attained about 13% increase in bus route
efficiency after first trial run of the model
* Analysed traffic, transport and population related data using different aggregate and logical functions in Excel, in
which these analysed data were inputs of the transport model
* Experienced cultures and administrations of one of the largest multinational engineering consulting firm
