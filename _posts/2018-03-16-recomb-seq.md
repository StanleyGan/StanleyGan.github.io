My paper titled _"Deconvoluting the Diversity of Within-host Pathogen Strains in a Multi-locus Sequence Typing Framework"_ is accepted for the [_RECOMB-Seq workshop 2018_](http://recomb2018.fr/recomb-seq/). It is also selected for publication in [_Bioinformatics_](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics) journal. This is a joint work with my supervisors Leonid Chindelevitch and Cedric Chauve, and our lab's undergraduate research assistant Elijah Willie. My supervisors will be presenting in the workshop at Paris, France. It was a long journey and finally it is accepted for publication! I will soon publish a post on this topic.
