Welcome to my page! My name is Stanley Gan and I am a Malaysian, now residing in the beautiful Vancouver, Canada. I am currently a Research-based MSc student in [_Simon Fraser University (SFU)_](https://www.sfu.ca/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Leonid Chindelevitch](http://www.sfu.ca/~leonid/#/home) and [Prof. Cedric Chauve](http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~cchauve/). My research is in the area of computational biology, focusing on applying optimization and machine learning problems in addressing biological problems.  

I am also currently a Research Intern in [1QBit](https://1qbit.com/). I started my internship in September 2017 and have been working on different computational intractable problems by harnessing the power of quantum computation and machine learning.  

Before moving to Vancouver, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science in the [_University of Hong Kong (HKU)_](https://www.hku.hk/).
